# AI Image Generator using OpenAI and Node.js

Welcome to the AI Image Generator project! This application leverages the power of OpenAI to generate images based on textual descriptions.


## Introduction

The AI Image Generator is a Node.js application that interacts with OpenAI's powerful GPT-3 model to create images from textual descriptions. You can provide a textual prompt, and the application will generate an image that matches the description.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the AI Image Generator [here](https://chimerical-platypus-eb4447.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Generate images from textual descriptions using OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
- Customizable prompts for generating a wide range of images.
- Simple and easy-to-use API.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: [Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/)
- OpenAI API Key: You need an API key from OpenAI to access their services. Get one [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the AI Image Generator:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-generator.git
   cd ai-image-generator
   
2.Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install

3. Configure your OpenAI API key by creating a '.env' file in the project root directory and adding your key:

     ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

## Usage
To generate images using the AI Image Generator, follow these steps:

1. Start the Node.js application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   
2. Access the application through your browser or API client.

3.Provide a textual prompt to generate an image. The application will send the prompt to the OpenAI API and display the generated image.

4. Experiment with different prompts to generate various images.
